print("The city was loud on this day, there on the street was a lonely young boy in rugged clothes with his twin sister. ")
print("They walk up to a stranger and offer to show the stranger some magic in exchange for some spending money. ")
print("The man takes pity on the young children, it seems magic is all they know. ")
print("He stops on this busy day to watch and enjoy their little magic trick. ")
print("He is shocked how good their magic skills are, thanks them, and hand them a large dollar bill. ")
print("He hesitatingly continues his walk to work. ")
print("Many questions come to his mind, such as; How did these children learn magic? Is this how this they make a living? ")
print("He never saw the twin children again, it seems he will never know.")
